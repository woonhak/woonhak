Since 2009, one of my hobby is reading opensource database code for fun.

I've learning opensource database internals by reading/modifying source code of PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

Unfortunately, I did not contribute my work many reason so far.

Recently, I've been asked to give a talk about kind of `database internals for dummies`
for helping colleagues who has no background knowledge.

Fortunately, I did similar talk since 2011 for students at SKKU, but everytime I spent too much time to find the materials on the cloud storage.

So I thought that it could be a good chance to publish some of old slides and re-haul according to the current versions. 
For contributing the community and myself.
